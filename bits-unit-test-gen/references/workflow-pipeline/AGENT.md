# Pipeline Workflow

This document defines the complete execution flow for **pipeline mode**. When the Orchestrator determines `workflow = pipeline`, it reads this document and executes accordingly.

Pipeline mode uses a multi-agent orchestration architecture. The Orchestrator dispatches Test Writer and Test Fixer subagents, producing a complete chain of intermediate artifacts (targets/ → results/).

## Preconditions

The following conditions have been completed by the Orchestrator (SKILL.md Step 1) before entering this workflow:

- `${TMP_ROOT}/task.json` has been written (with `workflow: "pipeline"`)
- `${TMP_ROOT}/targets/` directory has been created, containing the target function list
- Language-specific prompt determined (`assets/${LANG}/prompt.md`)
- `MODE` (`default` / `fix_only`) and `DEFECT_DETECTION` (`basic` / `deep`) determined

## Execution Flow

### Step 2: Execute Language-Specific Task Pipeline Per Requirements

Combine the language-specific rules in `assets/${LANG}/prompt.md` to execute the corresponding pipeline based on `MODE`.

Iterate through all files under `${TMP_ROOT}/targets/` (`ls targets/`); each file represents one minimum execution unit. By default, process units **serially one by one**:

**`default`**: For each execution unit, first dispatch Test Writer to generate tests and write to `${TMP_ROOT}/results/<unit_name>.json`, then dispatch Test Fixer to verify/fix and update the same file. Only proceed to the next unit after the current unit's Writer + Fixer are both complete.

**`fix_only`**: Skip Test Writer. For each execution unit, directly dispatch Test Fixer to read `${TMP_ROOT}/targets/<unit_name>.json`, verify/fix existing tests, and write results to `${TMP_ROOT}/results/<unit_name>.json` per the results specification.

> The language-specific prompt can override the default serial strategy and define a more efficient scheduling approach. For example, Go's prompt defines a "serial by package, per-file Writer within a package → unified Fixer" strategy.
> For detailed workflows of each agent, see `references/test-writer/AGENT.md` and `references/test-fixer/AGENT.md`.

### Step 3: Artifact Check and Output Summary

> `utree flush` has been executed uniformly by SKILL.md Step 3.2; no need to repeat here.

1. **Perform full artifact check**: Check `${TMP_ROOT}/task.json`, `${TMP_ROOT}/targets/`, and `${TMP_ROOT}/results/` according to the pipeline-mode rules in `references/output-contract/ARTIFACTS.md`.

2. **Conversation output summary**: Aggregate test-file and defect details from `results/`, and provide a **concise** summary in the conversation organized by test file dimension. See the "Conversation Output Rules" in `references/output-contract/FORMATS.md` for display rules.

    > Output SHOULD be compact — omit the defects section if no defects are found.
