## Null Pointer / Null Reference Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Module+ × Likely | Deterministic lifecycle defect on a nullable object/reference/dependency: entering the path causes an unrecovered crash or breaks through the core flow; structurally reaches multiple callers or sits on a shared path, and the affected path is a core business flow — makes core requests fail or core data corrupt. | In payment callback logic, immediately performing a status update on an order object that is explicitly nil. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Nullable constraint not correctly expressed or consumed; structurally scoped within a module but the affected path serves an important feature — under normal inputs the defect persistently produces runtime exceptions or failures in the affected function module, but does not terminate the process. | When querying user personal information, if the database returns no result, the code accesses fields of the return object directly without null check — every such query fails. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Insufficient null handling only triggers single-request failures or partial result anomalies under specific boundary inputs; structurally limited to a single code path not on a core business flow — fallback or isolation mechanisms prevent the impact from spreading. | In a background report generation feature, chain-calling `data.summary.count` where `summary` is nil for certain report types. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Nullable constraint expression is unclear or null-check responsibility is unassigned, but no runtime fault is formed; no active business path is affected — only readability / maintainability impact. | A utility function `Format(user *User)` neither performs a null check nor states in its contract that `user` cannot be nil. |

---

## Parameter Validation Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Module+ × Likely | Missing validation at core business input boundaries directly lets illegal input through; structurally the unguarded entry point serves multiple callers or a shared path, and the affected path is a core business flow — causing core data corruption or loss of control of core processes. | A transfer function does not validate that the amount must be greater than zero, allowing negative amounts to be passed in. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Key parameter format / range / combination / business legality validation is insufficient; structurally scoped within a module but the affected path serves an important feature — under normal erroneous inputs the defect persistently causes request failures or obviously wrong results. | The user registration interface does not validate username length or format — every malformed input passes through. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Incomplete validation dimensions or missing boundary conditions; structurally limited to a specific code path not on a core business flow — under specific input combinations causes local logic anomalies or resource waste, but fallback mechanisms limit the impact. | The `pageSize` parameter of a list query interface has no maximum value limit, allowing one million records to be queried at once. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Validation logic is scattered / duplicated / inconsistent in expression; no active business path is affected — does not change runtime results but increases maintenance cost when rules change. | Multiple functions each implement `userID` format validation independently with inconsistent error message copy. |

---

## Numeric Overflow / Truncation / Precision Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Module+ × Likely | Numeric range, precision, type, or conversion strategy has fundamental defects in core numeric paths (settlement, accounting, inventory, quotas); structurally the defective calculation sits on a shared path or serves multiple callers, and the affected path is a core business flow — directly causes cumulative deviation of core data or unacceptable business consequences. | Using `float64` to define order amounts and perform addition/subtraction operations. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Overflow, truncation, narrowing conversions, or precision loss in important feature calculations; structurally scoped within a module but the affected path serves an important feature — under common input ranges persistently produces obviously wrong results affecting important judgments. | Directly converting a 64-bit timestamp (`long`) to a 32-bit integer (`int`). |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Imprecise numeric processing strategies in boundary values or non-core calculation scenarios; structurally limited to a specific code path not on a core business flow — causes local deviations or threshold misjudgments, but the overall impact is limited. | Calculating the completion rate `5 / 10` yields 0 (integer division). |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Numeric semantics expression is unclear or type choices are not self-explanatory; no active business path is affected — does not directly cause wrong results but increases misreading risk. | `if (user.status == 3)`, where the meaning of `3` is unclear. |

---

## Type Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Broad/Module × Certain/Likely | Type constraints are fundamentally wrong in core protocols, message bodies, or persistence contracts; structurally the mistyped field sits on a cross-module or global path, and the affected path is a core business flow — directly causes type errors, deserialization failures, or core process unavailability. | The order status consumer program casts the `status` in the core message to an incompatible type, causing a panic during consumption. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Type assertions, downcasting, or generic assumptions are not met in important feature processing paths; structurally scoped within a module but the affected path serves an important feature — under normal inputs persistently triggers runtime exceptions or feature failures. | `Object obj = ...; Dog dog = (Dog)obj;`, but `obj` may not actually be a `Dog`. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Field type inconsistency with actual data in specific interfaces or boundary inputs; structurally limited to a specific code path not on a core business flow — causes local parsing failures or non-core feature anomalies. | `{"age": "20"}` in JSON is defined as `int age;` in code. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Overly broad type expression or missing static constraints; no active business path is affected — no fault formed but weakens compile-time guarantees. | Function parameters and return values extensively use `Object` or `any`. |

---

## Collection / Array / String Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Module+ × Likely | Deterministic defects in handling collection / array / string boundaries on core processing paths; structurally the defective operation sits on a shared path or serves multiple callers, and the affected path is a core business flow — directly triggers crashes or core data processing distortion. | In core settlement logic, a fixed wrong index is used to read an array, and entering that branch immediately causes out-of-bounds. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Index, slice, concatenation, or traversal boundary constraints are not correctly consumed in important features; structurally scoped within a module but the affected path serves an important feature — under common abnormal inputs persistently causes out-of-bounds, errors, or wrong results. | `int index = getIndexFromRequest(); String value = options[index];` — no bounds check. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Boundary parameters or non-core string/collection operations cause local runtime exceptions or result truncation in specific inputs; structurally limited to a specific code path not on a core business flow — the impact is limited to specific scenarios. | `str.substring(10, 5)` — invalid range on specific inputs. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Collection or string processing is not efficient enough or poor readability; no active business path is affected — does not affect correctness. | `String s = ""; for (...) { s += "x"; }` — inefficient concatenation. |

## Triage Examples

### Example 1: Null pointer in payment callback causes crash → P0

**Defect**: `service/payment.go:78` — In the payment callback handler, the code directly calls `order.UpdateStatus()` on an order object that may be nil when the order lookup fails.

```go
func HandlePaymentCallback(ctx context.Context, req *CallbackReq) error {
    order, _ := orderRepo.FindByID(ctx, req.OrderID) // err ignored, order may be nil
    order.UpdateStatus("PAID") // nil dereference → panic
    return nil
}
```

| Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impact Severity | **Catastrophic** | Nil dereference causes an unrecovered panic, crashing the request handler; in Go HTTP servers with no recover middleware this terminates the goroutine (process crash / unrecovered panic → Catastrophic) |
| Blast Radius | **Module-level** | The payment callback is a core business flow; `orderRepo.FindByID` returns nil when the order does not exist (e.g., duplicate callback, expired order). The panic affects the entire payment confirmation path |
| Trigger Probability | **Likely** | Payment gateways commonly send duplicate or delayed callbacks; the nil case is reached under normal operational conditions (matches signal ⑤ reachable via normal input) |

**Priority**: Critical impact (Catastrophic × Module-level) × Likely → **P0**, block merge.

### Example 2: Boundary-condition integer division by zero → P3

**Defect**: `utils/stats.go:45` — The completion-rate calculation does not guard against a zero denominator.

```go
func CompletionRate(done, total int) float64 {
    return float64(done) / float64(total) // panics when total == 0
}
```

| Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impact Severity | **Limited** | Integer division by zero causes a single-request panic but does not affect other requests or persistent data (single-request failure → Limited) |
| Blast Radius | **Local** | Called only by the single caller `ReportHandler`; no shared state or external side effects involved; not on a core business path |
| Trigger Probability | **Unlikely** | Only occurs for a newly created project with zero completed tasks (matches signal ⑧ boundary condition) |

**Priority**: Low impact (Limited × Local) × Unlikely → **P3**, does not block merge.
