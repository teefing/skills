# Security Vulnerabilities — P0–P3 Triage Rules

> This file is a referenced rule file for the `issue-severity-triage` Skill.
> It covers P0–P3 triage criteria (combining consequence severity, blast radius, and trigger probability) for **security vulnerabilities** (3 sub-categories).
>
> **How to use this file:**
> 1) First complete the independent three-dimension assessment (SKILL.md §5) and table lookup (§6) to determine the preliminary priority.
> 2) Use this reference to cross-validate: find the closest sub-category and Typical Profile row below.
> 3) If the independent assessment differs from the reference anchor, explain the reason in the 【分类与参考验证】section.

## Data / Interface Exposure Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Broad × Likely | Access control baseline for core data or high-risk capabilities is broken; structurally exposed to external or cross-module callers, and the compromised path sits on a core business flow — sensitive data or critical operations are completely out of control. | The user details query interface forgets to add permission validation, allowing traversal of user IDs to obtain all users' sensitive information. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Permission granularity is too coarse or authentication conditions have obvious defects at important interfaces; the exposure is structurally contained within a module but involves auth-sensitive operations whose compromise implicitly spreads — under normal access paths persistently produces privilege escalation or leakage of important capabilities. | The "system configuration" interface that should only be visible to administrators is also open to regular users. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Interfaces return excessive fields, internal identifiers, or information beyond the minimum necessary scope; structurally limited to specific endpoints not on core business paths — does not directly constitute high-risk leakage, but amplifies information gathering risk. Fallback mechanisms exist. | Production environment API error responses contain detailed database errors and code line numbers. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Exposure surface design is not restrained enough or information minimization is not thorough enough; no active business path is affected — actual exploitation value is currently low and only affects security governance consistency. | An internal debug interface returns the framework version number and non-sensitive build information, which is unnecessary for business functionality. |

## Unsafe Code Execution

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Broad × Likely | Directly exploitable execution surface is formed; external input can stably penetrate SQL, command, template, script, or interpreter execution paths — structurally reachable from external callers across module boundaries, and the compromised path grants access to core data and system capabilities. | The username field of the login interface is directly concatenated into the SQL query string. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | External input can stably affect page execution, script execution, template rendering, or dynamic interpretation on important features; structurally scoped within a module but the affected path serves user-facing or auth-related functions — causes session hijacking, privilege escalation, or important feature distortion. | User comment content is rendered directly in the page template without filtering. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | A potentially unsafe execution surface exists, but requires additional prerequisites, special configuration, or combined exploitation to trigger; structurally limited to a specific code path not on a core business flow — the current risk is real but exploitation difficulty is high and the impact is limited. | Using a library's XML parsing functionality that has an XXE vulnerability under specific configuration, but the code does not use that configuration. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Execution surface convergence is incomplete or whitelist / isolation boundary design is not stable enough; no active business path is affected and no directly exploitable vulnerability can form in the short term — a security baseline issue needing long-term governance. | An internal script tool still retains broad command whitelist matching logic, but the input source has been constrained to fixed constants. |

## Credential / Secret Exposure

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Catastrophic × Module+ × Certain | Sensitive credentials, keys, or production-level secrets are hardcoded directly into code or artifacts; the leaked credentials grant access to core systems — once pushed to version control, implicitly spreads to all data consumers of the compromised system. | `String pwd = "prod_db_password";`. |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Non-production but security-sensitive credentials (internal API tokens, OAuth client secrets for staging, service-to-service shared keys) are hardcoded in source code or committed configuration; the leaked credential does not directly grant production-level access but can be leveraged for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or staging-environment compromise — structurally scoped within a module but the exposed credential path serves authentication-sensitive operations whose compromise implicitly spreads trust boundary violations. | `var sec = "stg_client_sec_abc123"` hardcoded in a service initializer; not a production secret but grants access to the staging OAuth provider. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Non-production test credentials, internal-only tokens, or demo secrets appear in code; structurally limited to specific code paths and not directly deployable to production — reduces security posture but exploitation requires additional context. | A test file contains a hardcoded API key for the staging environment. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Credential management patterns are not clean enough; no actual secret is exposed — mainly affects security governance consistency. | Configuration loading code does not validate that secrets come from a secure source (env var / vault), but currently all callers do pass secrets correctly. |

## Triage Examples

### Example 1: User details endpoint has no authentication → P0

**Defect**: `handler/user.go:34` — The user details query endpoint performs no permission check; any caller can enumerate `userID` values to obtain all users' sensitive information.

```go
func GetUserDetail(ctx context.Context, req *GetUserReq) (*GetUserResp, error) {
    user, err := userRepo.FindByID(ctx, req.UserID) // no authentication check
    return &GetUserResp{Phone: user.Phone, IDCard: user.IDCard}, err
}
```

| Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impact Severity | **Catastrophic** | Authentication / authorization bypass — untrusted input can completely circumvent authorization and read user private data (auth bypass → Catastrophic) |
| Blast Radius | **Broad** | The endpoint is a public HTTP API accessible by any external caller; the leaked data covers the entire user table — structurally it is exposed to all external consumers, and from a business perspective it directly compromises core user data |
| Trigger Probability | **Likely** | Simply constructing sequential userIDs reliably triggers the leak; no special preconditions required (matches signal ⑤ reachable via normal input) |

**Priority**: Critical impact (Catastrophic × Broad) × Likely → **P0**, block merge.

### Example 2: Error response exposes stack trace → P1

**Defect**: `middleware/error_handler.go:22` — Production API error responses include full stack traces and database connection strings.

```go
func ErrorHandler(ctx context.Context, err error) {
    ctx.JSON(500, map[string]interface{}{
        "error":   err.Error(),
        "stack":   fmt.Sprintf("%+v", err),
    })
}
```

| Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impact Severity | **Limited** | Exposes internal paths and stack traces (non-credential information); widens the attack surface but does not directly constitute data leakage (low-sensitivity information exposure → Limited) |
| Blast Radius | **Broad** | Sits in the global error-handling middleware — a path traversed by all endpoint error responses; any 500 error leaks internal details to external callers across the entire service |
| Trigger Probability | **Unlikely** | Only exposed when a request triggers a 500 error (matches signal ⑪ triggered on exception-handling path) |

**Priority**: High impact (Limited × Broad) × Unlikely → **P1**, default block merge.
