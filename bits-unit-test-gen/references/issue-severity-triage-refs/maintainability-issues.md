# Maintainability Issues — P0–P3 Triage Rules

> This file is a referenced rule file for the `issue-severity-triage` Skill.
> It covers P0–P3 triage criteria (combining consequence severity, blast radius, and trigger probability) for **code maintainability problems** (naming/spelling, hardcoded non-secret values, logging/comments/docs, testing/debugging — 4 sub-categories).
>
> **How to use this file:**
> 1) First complete the independent three-dimension assessment (SKILL.md §5) and table lookup (§6) to determine the preliminary priority.
> 2) Use this reference to cross-validate: find the closest sub-category and Typical Profile row below.
> 3) If the independent assessment differs from the reference anchor, explain the reason in the 【分类与参考验证】section.
>
> **Note**: Credential / secret exposure (hardcoded passwords, keys, tokens) has been moved to [security-vulnerabilities.md](./security-vulnerabilities.md). This file only covers non-secret hardcoded values.

## Naming / Spelling / Punctuation Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Names, identifiers, or copy semantics are severely misleading — sufficient to stably induce incorrect understanding in extensions, reuse, or troubleshooting; structurally the affected symbol is an exported interface or shared within a module, but not on a core business path — does not directly constitute a runtime failure currently, but brings real risks to local feature evolution. | A function named `isValid()` actually performs a data deletion operation. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Non-standard naming, spelling errors, inconsistent capitalization, or inconsistent punctuation style; no active business path is affected — mainly affects readability and consistency without changing runtime results. | Variable named `usr` instead of `user`, or `calculateprice` instead of `calculatePrice`. |

## Hardcoded Non-Secret Values in Code

> For hardcoded credentials / secrets / keys, see [security-vulnerabilities.md → Credential / Secret Exposure](./security-vulnerabilities.md).

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P1** | Severe × Module × Likely | Important environment configurations, critical external dependencies, or key access parameters are hardcoded in business code; structurally scoped within a module but the affected configuration path serves important features — persistently causes important features to be unavailable or significantly increases delivery risk during deployment or environment switching. | Directly hardcoding `http://service-a.prod.internal` in the code instead of obtaining the service address through a configuration center. |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Business rule thresholds, policy parameters, or local configurations are scattered as hardcoded values; structurally limited to specific code paths not on core business flows — when rules change causes local behavior inconsistency or configuration drift, but fallback mechanisms limit the impact. | The risk control pass threshold `5` is scattered hardcoded in multiple service methods, making it prone to missing changes when rules are adjusted. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | A few non-critical constants, weakly expressive magic values, or local default values are hardcoded; no active business path is affected — mainly affects readability and maintainability without causing deterministic functional errors. | Hardcoded page size `pageSize = 10` in code, or `if (user.status == 3)` without a constant name explanation. |

---

## Logging / Comments / Documentation / Convention Errors

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Key business processes or important troubleshooting paths are missing necessary log context; structurally limited to specific code paths but the affected path serves an important diagnostic flow — significantly increases problem location difficulty or delays recovery, though does not directly change online execution results. | When payment fails, only printing "operation failed" without any associated order ID or user ID. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | Log levels, comment content, documentation descriptions, or convention details are not accurate, complete, or consistent enough; no active business path is affected — mainly affects team understanding and repository consistency. | A log that should be `DEBUG` level is set to `ERROR`, or comments have slight deviations from the code. |

---

## Testing / Debugging Issues

| Priority | Typical Profile | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **P2** | Limited × Local × Unlikely | Test case logic errors, key assertion distortion, missing boundary coverage, or debug residuals interfering with verification results; structurally limited to test/CI paths not on production business flows — causes local real defects to be missed, manifesting as online or regression problems later. | A test should check `a > 0`, but incorrectly asserts `a >= 0`, allowing a boundary bug through. |
| **P3** | Minor × Contained × Rare | General deficiencies in test stability, coverage, naming organization, readability, or debug cleanup; no active production path is affected — mainly affects development efficiency and code cleanliness without directly corresponding to deterministic production failures. | Tests depending on external services fail intermittently, or submitted code retains `System.out.println("debug here")`. |

## Triage Examples

### Example 1: Hardcoded service URL in business code → P1

**Defect**: `service/payment.go:15` — The payment service URL is hardcoded directly in the code instead of being read from configuration.

```go
func CallPaymentService(ctx context.Context, req *PayReq) (*PayResp, error) {
    resp, err := httpClient.Post("http://service-a.prod.internal/api/pay", req)
    return resp, err
}
```

| Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impact Severity | **Severe** | The payment feature becomes completely unavailable in any environment other than production (staging, testing, disaster recovery) — persistent feature failure during environment switching (persistent feature failure → Severe) |
| Blast Radius | **Module-level** | The hardcoded URL is used by all payment calls within the module; any environment change affects every payment operation — structurally scoped within the payment module but affects an important user-facing feature |
| Trigger Probability | **Likely** | Triggered on every deployment to a non-production environment (matches signal ⑤ reachable via normal operational conditions) |

**Priority**: High impact (Severe × Module-level) × Likely → **P1**, default block merge.

---

### Example 2: Misleading variable naming → P3

**Defect**: `service/user.go:67` — The function `isValid()` actually performs a deletion, severely misleading by its name.

```go
func (u *User) isValid() bool {
    db.Delete(&User{}, u.ID)
    return true
}
```

| Dimension | Verdict | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impact Severity | **Minor** | The naming issue itself does not change runtime behavior (note: the deletion logic is a separate independent defect); it only affects readability and maintainability (readability / maintainability degradation → Minor) |
| Blast Radius | **Module-level** | The method is exported and called from multiple places within the module; it serves as a shared interface whose misleading name could propagate misuse across callers |
| Trigger Probability | **Rare** | The misleading name can only introduce new defects when a future maintainer misuses it; currently no runtime error is produced (matches signal ⑫ current callers do not trigger) |

**Priority**: Low impact (Minor × Module-level) × Rare → **P3**, does not block merge.
