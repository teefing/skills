# TS/JS Defect Risk Scoring Standard v1.0

> This document provides JS/TS-specific defect scoring criteria for the Code Reviewer agent. It supplements the generic `detect-bugs.md` with frontend-specific patterns, trust boundary rules, and noise reduction principles.

## Core Principles

### Trust Boundary Degradation Principle

When a defect's trigger condition depends on "upstream component passing abnormal props" or "backend API returning dirty data", apply severity degradation. Frontend code reasonably trusts same-project upstream components and own backend APIs — such issues are "defensive programming gaps" rather than "certain defects".

Degradation rules:
- Originally 9-10 (certain crash) but trigger depends on upstream/backend abnormal data → downgrade to **P2**
- Originally 7-8 (high risk) but trigger depends on upstream/backend abnormal data → downgrade to **P2-P3**
- Only maintain original severity when data-flow analysis **confirms** the variable is necessarily abnormal on reachable paths within the current code

**IMPORTANT EXCEPTION — Do NOT apply degradation when:**
- The "abnormal" state is actually a **normal business scenario** (empty search results, empty filter results, API rate-limit/timeout response, user hasn't created any data yet)
- The function itself is responsible for producing the empty/null state (e.g., internal filter logic can produce empty array, then code accesses `[0]`)
- The response code/status indicates failure and is a documented API behavior (not "dirty data")

### False Positive Prevention Principle

The following situations **MUST NOT** be reported as defects:
- Design choices matching user expectations (e.g., component API allows overriding specific params via generics)
- When it cannot be confirmed whether upstream methods accept null values, do not assume null necessarily causes errors
- Read-only mode retaining copy functionality — matches common product design
- Initialization logic that only fires once (e.g., `useEffect(fn, [])` only runs on mount) — unless proven that data changes post-initialization actually cause problems
- Industry-common "could be better but doesn't affect functionality" patterns (e.g., React state update after unmount — no longer produces warnings in React 18+)
- Pure TypeScript type refinement issues that have no runtime impact (e.g., `as` casts between compatible types)
- Error handling that swallows errors on non-critical paths (metrics, logging, analytics)
- **Sentinel value patterns**: Using `0`, `""`, `null` as "no data" indicators and returning placeholder text (e.g., `if (!time) return '--'` where time=0 means "not set")
- **Intentional action availability**: Buttons/actions enabled in specific states by design (e.g., allowing delete on RUNNING tasks for abort-and-cleanup workflows)
- **Behavioral parameter differences between code paths**: Different paths providing slightly different params to callbacks — unless it causes data loss or crash
- **Read-then-write non-atomicity in single-user frontend**: `check existence → create/update` without DB locks — in browser context with single user, concurrent execution is practically impossible
- **Filter/search granularity choices**: Returning broader results than theoretically optimal — this is a product/UX decision

### Same-Pattern Deduplication Principle

The same defect pattern (e.g., useEffect missing cleanup, async setState missing unmount guard) in a single file should report **at most the most severe 1 instance**. If the same pattern appears across multiple files, report at most 1 per file. Do not template-apply the same pattern to every useEffect / every async function.

## Severity Levels (JS/TS Specific)

### P3: Style & Code Smell (Do NOT Report)

These are NOT defects — do not report or include in results:

1. Implicit `any` on function params/returns (unless `noImplicitAny` is confirmed enabled)
2. Naming convention violations (camelCase, PascalCase, UPPER_SNAKE)
3. Unused imports, unreachable code, unused variables
4. `var` without hoisting side-effects
5. Magic numbers or repeated string literals not extracted as constants
6. `as` type assertions between compatible parent-child types
7. Nested control flow > 4 levels (maintainability concern only)
8. Function body > 80 lines
9. Duplicated code blocks (AST similarity)
10. Array index as React/Vue list key in `.map()` callbacks

### P2: Boundary Risk (Report only when evidence is strong)

Specific input/timing conditions trigger the issue:

1. Direct property access on union type containing `null | undefined` without optional chaining or guard
2. Implicit type coercion: `==`/`!=` (non `== null` idiom), unary `+` for conversion, string concat with non-string
3. `any`-typed variable with direct `.prop` or `[key]` access
4. Async function call without try/catch, or `.then()` without `.catch()`
5. Array access via variable index without bounds check
6. Switch on union/enum missing `default` and not exhaustive
7. Type guard narrowing used after `await` boundary (value may have changed)
8. `as unknown as T` double assertion (incompatible type coercion)
9. Argument type mismatch detectable through type inference
10. **Trust boundary gap** (defensive programming): Missing null/abnormal defense on upstream props or backend response, but cannot confirm upstream necessarily passes abnormal values — **report at P2 maximum, usually skip**
11. Async race condition whose consequence is only UI flicker/toast flash, self-heals with no data side-effects
12. Async data loading timing issue causing brief wrong UI state, auto-recovers when data arrives
13. `useEffect(fn, [])` initialization logic that won't re-execute on subsequent changes, but cannot confirm actual problems
14. Controlled component not syncing external props changes (`useState(props.value)` without sync `useEffect`), when parent behavior is unconfirmed

### P1: High Risk (Probable runtime error or silent data corruption)

1. `any` value in arithmetic operations (+-*/) or assigned to strongly-typed variable without runtime typeof/schema validation
2. `fetch().json()` / `JSON.parse()` / `URLSearchParams.get()` / `localStorage.getItem()` return used without try/catch or schema validation when data source is untrusted
3. addEventListener without removeEventListener / setInterval without clearInterval / useEffect without cleanup — **only P1 when leak accumulates continuously** (e.g., re-binds every render); if only residual listener on unmount → P2
4. useEffect/lifecycle async callback calling setState without unmount check — **only P1 when async is long-running AND race consequence involves data submission or unrecoverable state**; if consequence is only console warning or UI flicker → P2; React 18+ projects further downgrade
5. Regex with nested quantifiers (`(a+)+`) or optional-repeat overlay — ReDoS risk
6. innerHTML / dangerouslySetInnerHTML / v-html with input from backend API without escaping → P1 (user-controlled input → P0)
7. Generic function without `extends` constraint, body accesses properties on generic param
8. `Object.keys(obj)` return used directly as `obj[key]` index (TS returns `string[]` not `(keyof T)[]`)
9. Custom type guard `is` implementation doesn't actually guarantee type correctness
10. `eval()` / `new Function()` / `setTimeout(string)` executing dynamic code
11. `obj[dynamicKey] = value` where dynamicKey from external input without filtering `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` (prototype pollution)
12. Closure capturing outer let/var that is modified after closure creation (including loop variable capture)
13. useEffect referencing reactive variables not in dependency array (stale closure / infinite re-render)
14. Comparing object/array references in useMemo/useEffect deps or `===` (new reference every render → infinite effect / memo bypass)
15. Event handler setState after await without AbortController/cancel mechanism, AND race consequence involves data submission
16. Non-whitelist fields bypassing validation being auto-saved/submitted (unauthorized auto-operation)

### P0: Critical Defect (Certain crash, data error, or security incident)

1. Data-flow confirmed variable is necessarily null/undefined on a reachable path, followed by unguarded property access (certain NPE)
2. Calling function/method on value confirmed to be null/undefined (frontend white-screen #1 cause)
3. `while(true)` without break/return exit; recursion without termination; useEffect deps triggering self-setState loop (infinite loop/recursion)
4. Condition expression contradicts its control flow semantics (e.g., `if(err) { saveData() }` should be `if(!err)`)
5. Floating-point used directly for currency/amount calculation without integer cents or Decimal library
6. setState called directly in render function/component body (infinite re-render)
7. `delete obj.id` then `save(obj)` where save accesses `obj.id`
8. Hard-coded API Key/Token/Secret strings (high-entropy + sensitive keywords)
9. Frontend URL concatenating userId/roleId controlling data access without backend verification (privilege escalation); innerHTML with user-controlled input without escaping
10. Calculation errors in amount/quantity/inventory/discount leading to over/under-charge, sign reversal
11. Time/timezone/timestamp errors causing timeout misjudgment, validity period errors, statistics offset
12. Pagination logic errors causing data duplication, omission, or page overflow
13. Form submission without debounce/throttle causing duplicate orders/payments/submissions
14. Critical business state check missing or incorrect, allowing cancelled/completed/disabled flows to continue
15. Sensitive operations (payment, refund, delete, export) without confirmation or permission check
16. Concurrent submission without idempotency control causing duplicate charges/oversell/data inconsistency
17. Function implementation completely contradicts its name/signature semantics (e.g., `checkNeedLogin` unconditionally returns false) — **MANDATORY DETECTION**: When a function's name/signature declares a dynamic semantic purpose (check, validate, verify, compute, fetch, ensure, guard, filter, etc.) but the implementation returns a fixed value without executing any logic corresponding to that purpose. The key criterion: the semantic purpose demands dynamic evaluation, yet the implementation is entirely static. MUST be reported as P0 regardless of whether caller/doc/invariant evidence is available. NOT caught: functions whose purpose IS to provide a constant (`getDefaultTimeout`, `getMaxRetries`).
18. Form validation failure not blocking submission (e.g., `form.validate().catch()` swallows error then continues submit)

## Scoring Application Rules

### When to Use This Document

This scoring standard is applied:
1. **During defect detection** (Step 4 of SKILL workflow) — to calibrate the severity of discovered JS/TS defects
2. **During Defect Verification** (post-review filtering) — to validate that reported defects meet the minimum severity threshold and are not false positives

### Minimum Reporting Threshold

- Only report defects at **P1 and above** (P0, P1)
- P2 defects may be reported only when evidence is conclusive and the defect clearly affects correctness
- P3 and below: NEVER report

### Quantity Control

> **优先级说明**：当本文件的数量限制与 `detect-bugs.md` 4.1 节的通用限制冲突时，以本文件（语言特定规则）为准。

Per source file, typically **0-5** defects are worth reporting. If you find more than 7, re-examine — but do not artificially cap at a low number if the defects are genuine and pass the 3-gate check.

### Pre-Report Self-Check (Every Defect Must Pass)

1. **Reachability**: Can the trigger input/state actually occur in normal usage? Remember: empty arrays, API errors, users with no data — these ARE normal. Only drop if trigger requires malicious input or impossible state combinations.
2. **Impact clarity**: What specifically happens when triggered? Must be crash, data error, functional failure, or security issue. "Could be improved" is insufficient.
3. **Bug vs design choice**: Is this a code error or an intentional design? Check the false-positive patterns in `defect-verifier.md` — if it matches, it's not a bug.
4. **Template application check**: Same pattern max 1-2 reports with the most severe instance.
