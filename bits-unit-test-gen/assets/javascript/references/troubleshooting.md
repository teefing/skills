# Error Diagnosis and Fix Strategies

Common JavaScript/TypeScript unit test verification failures. Fix test files or test-side infrastructure/mock/config adaptation; do not modify production code.

## Module Resolution Errors

### `Cannot find module`

Symptoms: test run reports `Cannot find module 'xxx'`.

Common causes:

- Wrong relative import path in the test.
- Source file uses path aliases, for example `@/utils`, but the test framework lacks matching alias config.
- Dependency is platform/environment-specific and does not exist in the test runtime.

Fixes:

- First correct the test import path.
- Check Jest `moduleNameMapper` or Vitest/Rstest `resolve.alias`.
- Mock dependencies that cannot resolve in test runtime and are not the behavior under test.

```ts
jest.mock('@/utils/helper', () => ({}), { virtual: true });
```

### Rush repo tries raw pnpm

Symptoms:

- `pnpm install` in a package directory cannot resolve `workspace:*` dependencies.
- pnpm reports missing `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- The agent creates `pnpm-workspace.yaml` or switches registries repeatedly.

Fixes:

- Stop the raw pnpm path. If `rush.json` exists, use Rush commands from `engineering.md`.
- Do not create workspace metadata to make raw pnpm work in a Rush repo.
- If a pnpm diagnostic is truly needed, use `rush-pnpm` rather than direct `pnpm`.
- Keep the project registry config; private packages usually will not resolve from public registries.
- If Rush reports Node is outside `nodeSupportedVersionRange`, switch to a supported Node before retrying.
- If global Rush is missing or does not match `rush.json#rushVersion`, use `common/scripts/install-run-rush.js` instead of the global binary.
- If Rush/pnpm fails with `onlyBuiltDependencies?.sort is not a function`, check user/global pnpm config for comma-string `only-built-dependencies`. Isolate or fix that user config, then retry the same Rush command; do not bypass Rush with raw pnpm.

## Test Path Problems

### `No tests found`

Symptoms: test command does not discover the new test file.

Common causes:

- Test path does not match `testMatch` / `testRegex` / `include`.
- Test file is excluded by `testPathIgnorePatterns` / `exclude`.
- Test file suffix does not match project convention.

Fixes:

- Read framework config and confirm matching patterns.
- Move or rename the test file to match existing project style.
- Component tests with JSX should use `.tsx`, not `.ts`.

## Babel / Transform Errors

### `SyntaxError` in mock factory

Symptoms: `jest.mock` factory reports `Unexpected token`, `Missing semicolon`, etc.

Cause: Babel may parse hoisted `jest.mock` factories without TypeScript transform.

Fixes:

- Remove type annotations, `as` assertions, and generic calls from the mock factory.
- Use `(x) =>`, not `(x: string) =>`.
- Do not put JSX in mock factories; use `require('react').createElement` if unavoidable.

### `Cannot use import statement outside a module`

Symptoms: source file or dependency ESM imports cannot be parsed by the current test runtime.

Fixes:

- Reuse existing project transform config.
- Mock hard-to-transform modules that are not the behavior under test.
- In Jest ESM projects, follow existing `jest.unstable_mockModule` or dynamic import style.

## DOM / Environment Errors

### `document is not defined` / `window is not defined`

Cause: component or hook depends on DOM, but tests run in node environment.

Fixes:

- Jest: add `/** @jest-environment jsdom */` or use project jsdom config.
- Vitest: add `// @vitest-environment jsdom`.
- Rstest: add `// @rstest-environment jsdom`.

### `Cannot assign to read only property`

Cause: some jsdom `window` properties are read-only.

Fix:

```ts
Object.defineProperty(window, 'xxx', { value: mockValue, writable: true });
// or
jest.spyOn(window, 'xxx', 'get').mockReturnValue(mockValue);
```

## Mock Problems

### `Cannot access 'mockXxx' before initialization`

Cause: `jest.mock()` / `vi.mock()` / `rs.mock()` factory references a `let` / `const` that is not initialized yet.

Fix:

```ts
jest.mock('./mod', () => ({ fn: jest.fn() }));
const { fn: mockFn } = jest.requireMock('./mod');
```

Vitest uses `vi.hoisted`; Rstest should avoid external factory references or use supported non-hoisted mock APIs.

### i18n / router / store `is not a function`

Cause: mock shape does not match real exports, or default/named export is mixed up.

Fixes:

- Match the source import style and provide the correct default/named export.
- i18n can usually return the key.
- Prefer existing router/store test helpers.

## TypeScript Compile Problems

### Test-file type errors

Fixes:

- Reuse exported source types.
- Cast mock functions to the framework mock type or use existing helpers.
- Fix test-related type errors or language-authorized test infrastructure issues, such as missing test framework types or test config.

### Source-file type errors

Do not modify production code. Mock hard-to-compile dependencies if necessary, or focus on tests that can be verified under current project config.

## Timeout and Async Leaks

### Test command timeout

Use the `prompt.md` timeout wrapper. Timeout exits often appear as `124` (`timeout`) or `142` / `SIGALRM` (Perl fallback).

Common causes:

- Network, WebSocket, timers, subscriptions, or external services are not mocked.
- Promise never resolves/rejects.
- React/Vue component enters an infinite update loop.
- `npx` or package tooling is waiting for interactive install/confirmation input.

Fixes:

- Avoid interactive package execution; prefer project scripts or local package-manager exec after dependency preflight.
- Mock all external async dependencies.
- Use fake timers and restore real timers after the case.
- Wait for async state to settle before asserting.
- If the same case keeps timing out, delete or rewrite it and keep stable useful coverage.
